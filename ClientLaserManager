-- Since we called the FireAllClients event, that means all clients will receive an event from the server to render their laser beam.
-- Because of this, that will cause all players to display two laser beams, and to avoid that, we will ignore the players laser if shot by another player.
-- If the localPlayer is not the player who shot (you), then this script allows the laser beams start/endPosition will be from the other players toolHandle
-- If we didn't do this, the laser would render from the other player, and for all localPlayers on the server.
